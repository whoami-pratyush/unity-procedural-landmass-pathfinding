#### Dissection:
```cs
    public void DrawNoiseMap(float[,] noiseMap)
```

This method finally takes in the ==Noise Map== generated by the [[Noise.cs V1]].

```cs
Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(width, height)
```

We created a new texture so that we can apply the colors in it and later put this texture on the plane.

```cs
colorsMap[y * width + x] = Color.Lerp(Color.black, Color.white, noiseMap[x, y]);
```

We use <abbr title = "Lerp is basically linear interpolation in unity, here it interpolates the color black and white with affecting factor is the value of noise at coordinate x,y">Color.Lerp</abbr> to get the color on the texture map.

```cs
        texture.SetPixels(colorsMap);
        texture.Apply();

        textureRenderer.sharedMaterial.mainTexture = texture;
        textureRenderer.transform.localScale = new Vector3(width, 1, height);
```

Finally here we set the colors on the texture.
